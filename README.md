# Anime Stock Web Project
## Introduction into the project
### The desing of this application is created by me to work for all devices from the smallest phone screens to 1920px.
This web project is made for the Asp.Net Advanced course in SoftUni. The web application is for purcahsing digital or physical copies of light novels and manga.
The user can choose to pre-order or order books depending on their availability. The books have tags and are either digital or physical. Books can be displayed as either
pre-orderable, orderable or unavailable depending on their quantity, release date and print type.

### There are 3 roles:
User role which is able to purchase books and favorite them. Administrator role which is able to make users into moderators or moderators into users, is able to do everything like adding or removing books and tags or deleting comments,
Moderator role can do everything admin can do but changing the users and other moderators.

## Functionality
### Login/Register
Users are able to register and login. Users are able to comment under books only if logged in.

### Ordering
Users are able to order books only if they have a registration. Digital books can be downloaded directly upon ordering.
